            <b> What is an NFT? </b>
            An NFT is a digital asset stored on the blockchain. These assets
            hold information, like descriptions, properties, and media files.
            NFTs are unique, one-of-a-kind, and non-interchangeable. The history
            of every NFT is recorded on the blockchain, meaning buyers can prove
            their ownership and creators can receive royalties every time their
            work is re-sold. NFTs can be traded on marketplaces, proudly
            displayed in online galleries or used to access exclusive content
            and real-life experiences.

            <b> How to get started? </b>
            Currently, we’re most interested in promoting projects that have
            multi-tiered sales (i.e. 1-of-1s, 1-of-manys, etc), have interesting
            & unique artwork, include robust digital unlockable content
            experiences, and have already been marketed in well-trafficked
            channels. If you fit this description, please fill in our
            partnership request
